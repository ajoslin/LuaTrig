LuaTrig
=======

A program to write Age of Empires II triggers in Lua scripting language.

Credits
-------

The sources for the following programs helped me out a ton when making LuaTrig.

[AoK Trigger Studio, by DiGiT](http://sourceforge.net/projects/aokts/)

[Trigger Script Editor, by Jatayu](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=10278)

Dependencies
------------

These libraries are necessary to compile and develop LuaTrig.

[Swig](http://www.swig.org/)

[wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/)

[zlib](http://zlib.net/)

Notes
-----

LuaTrig is made for Windows, but it should compile on Linux as well if you add '-lz' to the libs line in the Makefile.
Mac is untested.
